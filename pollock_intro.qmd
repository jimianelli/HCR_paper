## Context: Why This Matters Now

The fundamental challenge facing Alaska fisheries management is that **we don't know how recruitment productivity will respond to ongoing climate change**. Stock-recruitment steepness ($h$)—the fraction of unfished recruitment maintained at 20% of unfished biomass—is one of the most critical yet uncertain parameters driving sustainable harvest levels.

When steepness is high (stock maintains recruitment at low biomass), fishing mortality rates can be higher without risking recruitment overfishing. When steepness is low (recruitment collapses rapidly at reduced biomass), sustainable fishing rates must be much more conservative. This parameter difference has enormous consequences: a 50% difference in steepness can translate to 30-40% differences in maximum sustainable yield and substantially different safe fishing mortality rates.

**The climate problem**: Environmental drivers—warming, changes in prey availability, shifts in recruitment success—may alter steepness over time [@Szuwalski_etal_2023; @Hollowed_etal_2020]. Yet our current management procedures assume steepness is stable and known. If we misidentify productivity trends, or if steepness changes and we fail to detect it, we risk either severe overfishing or unnecessary conservation that sacrifices yield.

## The Management Dilemma: Transparent Rules vs. Adaptive Complexity

Two competing pressures now face the Council:

**Pressure 1 (Adaptability)**: Climate-resilient HCRs that incorporate environmental covariates promise to adjust fishing rates based on ecosystem conditions. In theory, if we can measure environmental drivers (temperature, prey biomass), we can modulate fishing rates to track changes in productivity.

**Pressure 2 (Transparency & Accountability)**: Current tier-based HCRs are transparent—everyone understands the decision rule. Spawning biomass is measured; reference points are calculated from biological parameters; fishing rates follow directly. This clarity enables accountability and public confidence.

The tension: Environmental covariates add another layer of uncertainty and interpretation. An environmental proxy for productivity (e.g., temperature predicting steepness) is itself uncertain and requires validation. **Adding a proxy-for-a-proxy compounds uncertainty without necessarily improving management outcomes.**

---

## The Core Question: Can We Find a Resilient Proxy?

Rather than choosing between transparency and adaptability, we should ask: **What management procedure is both transparent AND demonstrably robust to productivity changes?**

This simulation study tests this question using a simplified, pollock-like population model under two steepness scenarios [@NPFMC_FMP_2024]:
- **Low steepness (h=0.6)**: Represents a less productive stock, vulnerable to overfishing at low biomass
- **High steepness (h=0.9)**: Represents a more productive stock, resilient to reduced biomass

We hold the **harvest control rule constant** (a sloping F40% SPR-based rule with biomass ramp from 0.4B₀ to 0.05B₀, consistent with Tier 3 framework) and ask: **How well does this single transparent rule perform across both productivity scenarios?**

---

## Why This Approach Matters for Climate-Resilient Management

If a transparent, SPR-based HCR performs well—maintaining acceptable biomass levels, generating reasonable yields, and avoiding recruitment overfishing—across a range of productivity scenarios, then we have evidence of a **functionally proven** management procedure. We don't need to predict or respond to environmental changes in real-time; instead, we rely on a rule that is robust to the uncertainty inherent in those changes.

Conversely, if the rule's performance degrades substantially under different productivity regimes, we have evidence that **productivity-dependent management IS necessary**, and we can use this simulation to:

1. Quantify the consequences of misidentifying steepness
2. Design environmental covariates that are statistically robust and operationally transparent
3. Establish back-testing requirements before adopting climate-adjusted HCRs
4. Set decision thresholds for when to shift between management strategies

## Simulation Design: A Tractable Test of Management Robustness

This pollock-like model is intentionally stylized to remain transparent and reproducible:

- **Age structure**: 15 age classes with Bering Sea-like growth and maturity schedules
- **Stock-recruitment**: Beverton-Holt with variable steepness; recruitment variability at CV=0.7
- **Harvest control rule**: F40% (SPR proxy for Fmsy) with sloping biomass ramp
- **Scenarios**: Two steepness values representing low and high productivity
- **Simulation**: 50-year trajectories with 100 Monte Carlo replicates per scenario

The model does NOT include explicit environmental covariates or ACLIM-style ecosystem forecasting [@Hollowed_etal_2020]. Instead, steepness shifts represent a reduced-form proxy for climate-driven productivity changes. This simplification allows us to isolate the management question: **What happens when the true productivity parameter shifts from our assumption?**

---

## Expected Outputs: Evidence for Decision-Making

The simulation produces three classes of results:

1. **Reference points** (Table 1): How Fmsy, Bmsy, and MSY differ between steepness scenarios
2. **Single-scenario performance** (Figures 1-2): How the fixed HCR performs over 50 years in each productivity regime
3. **Sensitivity & robustness** (Figures 3-4): How catch and biomass outcomes vary as we shift steepness, and how performance compares to constant-F management

These results allow the SSC and Plan Team to evaluate whether:
- The chosen HCR is "robust enough" to unforecast steepness changes (functional proof under uncertainty)
- The HCR remains transparent and operationally simple despite productivity shifts (transparency maintained)
- Thresholds exist for when biomass or catch trends suggest a steepness shift has occurred (adaptive triggers without constant re-parameterization)

## Bridging to the Broader HCR Decision

This simulation directly informs the January decision on climate-resilient HCRs:

**If the fixed SPR-based HCR is robust** across steepness scenarios → we have a transparent, functionally proven procedure that doesn't require environmental covariates or complex re-tuning. We can defend it to the public and other stakeholders.

**If the fixed HCR is NOT robust** → we have quantified evidence that productivity-dependent management is necessary, and we can use this framework to design and back-test environmental covariates with transparent decision rules and thresholds.

Either way, the Council has evidence—not just theory—to inform its June decision on HCR adoption.
